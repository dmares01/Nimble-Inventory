## What does it do?
As of right now? It is nothing more than a simple hello world script but the future holds big plans my friend. The aim is to make an inventory tracker for a local coffee shop that can not only keep track of the simple things, think lids, cups, straws, etc, but also keep track of how much syrup or milk is left. 

This will be done by creating a recipe for each drink that is made at the store. Let's say you order a mocha with some caramel in it. At the end of the day the wonderful barista that served you would enter in one caramel mocha (and the corresponding size), and the tracker would know that not only did you use a cup and a lid, but also two scoops of chocolate, four pumps of caramel, and a number of scoops of coffee beans required for that size. This way bottles of syrup and gallons of milk can be more accurately tracked, and hopefully less waste will be produced. Since they buy everything local, it breaks the farmers heart to see milk going bad when he comes to pick up the glass bottles. We don't like broken hearts, so we need to fix this. 

Ideally we will have each drink, the ingredients, and then also allow a way for the barista to edit the options in case something changes. 

## Future Features
- Store all inventory items in local database structure
- Allow changes to be made to that database by the user
- Add pictures for each drink to help UI look pretty
- Add list of drinks and ingredients
- Print/email list of what inventory items are running low for stock order
- Keep track of how much of each ingredient is used to calculate averages
- Use averages to determine how much of each ingredient needs to be in stock
